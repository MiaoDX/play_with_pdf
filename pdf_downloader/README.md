# Pdf downloader from [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com)

This is motivated by [confdown](https://github.com/unitial/confdown) and the `download.py` is just a copy with minimal changes of [gs_gen_wget.py](https://github.com/unitial/confdown/blob/master/gs_gen_wget.py).

The `download.pool.py` is download with `Pool`, many thanks to [Marcus McCurdy's great post](https://www.toptal.com/python/beginners-guide-to-concurrency-and-parallelism-in-python).
